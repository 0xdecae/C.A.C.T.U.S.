# C.A.C.T.U.S.
Compact Automated Cluster of Tactically Useful Services


Ammunitions container cluster of 3-9 Raspberry Pi 3b+ with a Pi 4 lead node.

Possible network architecture:

	- Pi Cluster of computing power
		+ Functions:
			= DDoS --> Forced MITM
				- DDoS test case, they all dont have to communicate for that due to it only being a command
				- However, the computing power may be a bit off, and the heat generated will be disastrous
			= Distributed computing to possibly help with other functions
	- SLC (cluster?) of Pirate boxes
